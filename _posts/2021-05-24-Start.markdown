Lenovo Legion 5 Ryzen 7 4800H L2 Cache 4MB, 32 GB Ram, GTX 1660 TI 6GB GDDR6
Cinemark Score: 10852

My previous dev machine was a desktop with an i7-67000K cpu and 32GB ram.
it had a Cinemark Benchmark score of 5048, which is not really bad for a 5 year old machine.
This laptop is twice as fast. I wish I could get my nvm ssd out of it into the laptop.

My previous laptop was a Yogo with an i7-8550U and 16 GB ram. Cinemark Benchmark: 2389.
I sent that machine to college with the youngest daughter. It runs circles around her windows surface pro.
She'll be able to zoom with it at least.

Random Not Deep Thoughts:
In other news, I'm designing a simple rule microservice. It's a hobby.
Designing a dev ops process during the day.

Evaluating the AWS Dev Ops offerings, comparing them to Azure DevOps.
I have post traumatic stress from Azure DevOps, but so far, I can't recommend against it.

Note: If the only true comments you can make in a pull request involve punctuation in comments and
whitespace, all your colleagues hate you. 

I'm using Visual Studio Code right now to force myself to like it. Thought about using Sublime, 
but decided not to swim upstream all the time.
