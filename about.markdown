Hey.

I'm a software architect in Kansas City, with current interests in Azure, C#, .Net Core, Microservices, REST APIs, and architectural modeling. In past lives I've done C, Lisp, C++, JQuery, ASP MVC, and Java. I enjoy learning new technologies, working primarily in Azure for the last 5 years, and really wish there was time to dive into AWS as well. My side pandemic project is building a CQRS\Event Sourced MicroService, because that will hit a whole lot of buzzwords in one go. Then the whole thing will be squeezed into Docker just out of spite.
