• I have significant experience in lead roles such as Enterprise Architect, Sr. Software Developer, and Software Development Manager.

• My current project is a current state analysis of a medical lab environment that integrates COTS lab applications with custom development and lab instruments with the goal of high availability and reliability.

• One of my recent projects was designing & implementing a Microservice Architectural framework using .Net Core, CQRS, Domain Driven Design (DDD), and Azure Service Bus for a v2 Insurance Platform. The primary design goals were to integrate with external vendor & legacy systems and migrate to an Azure-based cloud infrastructure. DDD & CQRS were chosen to insulate the application from non-normalized legacy data structures via a Message Broker so that the application could be refactored and redeployed as smaller independent components. Documented framework & requirements using Enterprise Architect and working with development team learn the Azure platform. Designed and developed REST APIs for various projects. Helped set up DevOps processes, Git processes, and DevOps intergrations.

• Worked as an architect with subject matter experts to design and analyze business processes & requirements using UML Activity, Class & Deployment diagrams to create, evaluate, & document technical designs and architectures. Also working with project managers to evaluate critical path tasks & schedules.

• Buzzwords: Experience using C#, .Net Core 3.2, Azure native cloud technologies, REST Microservices, Entity Framework, Dapper, jQuery, CSS, Bootstrap

• Significant experience in data architecture/modeling using Enterprise Architect/ERWin. I've worked to develop current state/future state analysis for large enterprise systems in telecommunications, engineering, insurance, and charities.

• Used object oriented languages starting with C++ and Java, with the last 10 years focusing on C#. Most of my projects have been data oriented (SQL Server, Oracle) but I've done front end as well. I learned coding using lisp and c on a vax, but probably shouldn't admit that.

• Also have experience building several software development teams and established Agile software development processes with Kanban & Scrum, performance metrics, production deployments & change management processes. Prefer Kanban to Scrum, but can do both.
